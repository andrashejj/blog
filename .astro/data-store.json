Lucky for me, one of my good friends Tamas was doing the same, so we happily drank alcohol-free beer together.\n- We are looking at a new chapter with my dad.\n- At NBK Labs, we went separate paths with our lead developer Raphael, so I had to take on a big part of frontend development.\n- I decided to refresh my CSS and React skills at the beginning of January. Still in the middle of it, and I love the journey.\n- We took a week of half work and half holiday with my family and went skiing to the Austrian Alps. It was ice cold but amazing.\n- We got a nasty letter from FINMA and had to change our branding from nobank to something new (coming soon).\n- We got our first month where we were cashflow neutral.\n\nWith this behind us, and roughly 10 months to go this year, I also set focus for the next period for myself and the company:\n\n- Sell more and make sure we are in the green.\n- Enjoy life and continue the dry January momentum.\n- Finish CSS and React brush-ups.\n\nCopyright 2022 Andras Hejj","content/posts/2023-02-09-full-on-business.mdx","9a294489a18ad948","first-week-in",{"id":32,"data":34,"body":42,"filePath":43,"digest":44,"deferredRender":17},{"title":35,"date":36,"slug":32,"summary":37,"coverImage":38,"tags":39},"First Week In...","2023-01-11","A January check-in on health, learning, and early momentum in both personal and professional goals.","https://picsum.photos/id/1043/1600/900",[28,40,41],"family","career","January is always an interesting month. As the year turns over, people are often in one of two states: half of us are still waking up from the holiday break, while the other half is rushing to ensure they catch the new year.\n\nRegardless of which camp we fall into, it is a time of renewed energy and focus.\n\nFor me, this year started off great so far. I have been able to fully recharge my batteries during the Christmas break and have returned feeling energized and ready to take on new challenges.\n\nI have also taken the time to reflect on the past year and identify the areas where I want to focus my energy in the coming months.\n\nOne of my key resolutions for the new year is to maintain a dry January. While it may seem small, this resolution is a powerful way to reset and focus on my health.\n\nI have also committed to staying active and doing regular sports and exercise. Recently, I tried bodypump for the first time, and while it was challenging, I felt great afterwards.\n\nIn addition to personal goals, I am also focused on professional growth and development. I have already met with several clients and closed some of the first deals of the year.\n\nI have also been dedicating time to learning new skills, specifically CSS (thanks [joshwcomeau.com](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)) and MPC (Secure Multi-Party Computation) and threshold signature schemes used to protect cryptographic assets besides smart wallets.\n\nThere is a great article about this by 1kx network: [Wallets](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/wallets-91c7c3457578).\n\nAs we move through January and into the rest of the year, I am optimistic about the opportunities and challenges ahead. With a renewed focus on health, personal development, and professional growth, I am confident this will be a successful and rewarding year.\n\nCopyright 2022 Andras Hejj","content/posts/2023-01-11-first-week-in.mdx","29f9859ba6fe7b6a","boring-or-fancy",{"id":45,"data":47,"body":54,"filePath":55,"digest":56,"deferredRender":17},{"title":48,"date":49,"slug":45,"summary":50,"coverImage":51,"tags":52},"Boring or Fancy","2025-10-21","A reflection on challenge, control, compensation, and finding a sustainable balance in career choices.","https://picsum.photos/id/1067/1600/900",[53,41],"startups","Ever since I started working on my own topics at NBK Labs, this question has never let me go: do you engage in a topic, and if so, what is your motivation?\n\nAs you start your working life, you often have trade-offs:\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"my-6 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4\">\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"p-4 rounded-lg bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800 text-center\">\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"text-2xl mb-2\">🎯\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"font-semibold\">Challenge\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"text-sm text-gray-500\">is this boring?\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"p-4 rounded-lg bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800 text-center\">\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"text-2xl mb-2\">🎮\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"font-semibold\">Control\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"text-sm text-gray-500\">can I steer?\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"p-4 rounded-lg bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800 text-center\">\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"text-2xl mb-2\">💰\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"font-semibold\">Money\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"text-sm text-gray-500\">does this pay?\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\nThere is probably more, and I may revisit this article later, but for now I have a simple conclusion.\n\nWhen I was younger, I felt I should chase challenge so I could learn. Once I felt qualified, I wanted control. Then I felt entitled to money.\n\nNowadays it is different. Maybe because I have put in the work to become good, to feel entitled, and to feel I can pick between boring vs fancy, in control vs controlled. I do not really care in absolute terms. I am happy to do the boring, and I am happy to be controlled as long as it pays handsomely and there is upside (equity).\n\nI can perform best in boring situations where I am just slightly out of my comfort zone.\n\nI recently had this encounter again at a new venture I am building: Motif. At Motif, we are building the first independent wealth advisor, agentic and working only for you. It is very exciting, but there are technology challenges that are really difficult to overcome. You need very bright people to solve them, and many have not been properly solved or documented before, so it feels a lot like R&D.\n\nEven when you solve a hard problem, the dopamine hit is very short-lived, and the next challenge is already around the corner.\n\nOn the flip side, I have a tech leadership mandate at a company called MCO (My Compliance Office). Even the name is the definition of boring. Everything about the company is boring by stereotype, and the company does great. Really great. There is no question people are performing there, and it pays handsomely.\n\nAfter seeing both sides, I still do not have a final conclusion.\n\nFancy is very exhausting. You often feel lost or alone, and once one big problem is solved, the next one appears. Even if the platform works, it can feel like walking through mud, never fully in flow.\n\nBoring has its own risks. It is easy to slip into rhythm, not push, and not give extra energy.\n\nFor now, balancing both sides makes the most sense to me:\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"my-6 space-y-2\">\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"flex items-center gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20\">\n    \u003Cspan className=\"text-green-500\">→\u003C/span>\n    \u003Cspan>when I have energy to push, I work on ventures\u003C/span>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"flex items-center gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20\">\n    \u003Cspan className=\"text-blue-500\">→\u003C/span>\n    \u003Cspan>when I feel exhausted, I perform well in a boring role\u003C/span>\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"my-10 p-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 via-gray-800 to-gray-900 rounded-2xl text-white text-center\">\n  \u003Cp className=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-light leading-relaxed\">\n    Balance is not about choosing one.

Not just from the amount of alcohol I consumed the previous night, although we had a big tasting round with my wife and our friends Arpi and Nunu from Tomcsanyi Birtok, but it felt different this time.\n\nI had this hangover from a really long and tiring year: starting a company, raising two kids, trying to keep a work-wife-life balance, illness in the family, war, uncertainty, economic distress, and so much more.\n\nIf I look back, it was a really successful year with so much joy and new experiences, but definitely not an easy one.\n\nAfter the hangover came the quiet. We are lucky enough that my wife and I have awesome parents who love taking care of our kids, so we could sneak two days away. It was beautiful, relaxing, and we finally had the chance to talk, review the year that passed so fast, and plan the year ahead.\n\nOut of this came four goals I want to accomplish this year personally and professionally:\n\n1. Successfully finish dry January and replace drinking with sports.\n2. Start cooking again. Every Friday night will be reserved for cooking with friends and family.\n3. Be more calm and relaxed, trust myself, and keep helping others.\n4. Get ready for Budapest while keeping the main base in Switzerland.\n\nAll of these goals are achievable and it is not too much.

How would you style a div so it is full-page height?\n\nTalk about internationalization and LTR/RTL. How would you style a paragraph with a `1em` margin at the end of text?\n\nTalk about margins. How would you style a footer with predictable spacing?\n\nCan you name different positioning algorithms and how they work?\n\n- `static` (default)\n- `initial`\n- `absolute`\n- `fixed`\n- `relative`\n- `sticky`\n\nExplain the logic of an absolutely positioned element. How will it be positioned with `inset: 10px`?\n\n## Stacking context\n\nWhat is a stacking context? What are different ways to create one?\n\n- Setting `opacity` to a value less than `1`\n- Setting `position` to `fixed` or `sticky`\n- Applying a `mix-blend-mode` other than `normal`\n- Adding a `z-index` to a child inside a `display: flex` or `display: grid` container\n- Using `transform`, `filter`, `clip-path`, or `perspective`\n- Explicitly creating a context with `isolation: isolate`\n\nHow do you achieve a container that can overflow on the y-axis but not on x-axis?\n\nOne practical pattern is to use an outer wrapper to control clipping/rounding and an inner scroller to control the overflow behavior.\n\nCopyright 2022 Andras Hejj","content/posts/2023-02-01-frontend-interview.mdx","7d61c4fdc4fa5a75","knowledge-is-power-or",{"id":80,"data":82,"body":91,"filePath":92,"digest":93,"deferredRender":17},{"title":83,"date":84,"slug":80,"summary":85,"coverImage":86,"tags":87},"Knowledge is power, or..?","2026-02-13","Why structured, time-aware knowledge is becoming core infrastructure for modern product building.","/images/posts/knowledge-is-power-or-cover.png",[88,89,90],"product","ai","knowledge","I think a lot about knowledge these days. Not in a smart way. In a survival way.\n\nBuilding digital products right now feels like trying to drink from a firehose. Every week there is a new tool, new framework, new must-know pattern, new way to reach users, and new way to lose them.\n\nThe old rhythm does not really work anymore: ship features, check metrics, repeat. That used to be enough. It is not now.\n\nNow the game is understanding. Not just understanding the tech, but understanding who the user actually is, what problem they are really facing, what they already tried, what they are afraid of, and what solved looks like for them.\n\nThis is the hard part. Not building. Building is the easy part. The hard part is knowing what to build, why, and for whom.\n\nThat is why I started thinking in graphs, not lists. A personal knowledge graph is just a fancy way of saying: connect what you learn to what you build.\n\nI use Obsidian for this: simple notes, linked thoughts, small reflections after user calls, experiments, failed launches, and aha moments. Not perfect notes. Useful notes.\n\n- notes about users (their words, not mine)\n- notes about problems (what is real, what is assumed)\n- notes about solutions (what worked, what flopped, what surprised me)\n- notes about decisions (why we chose A over B)\n\nIf we do not build our own memory system, we outsource our thinking to randomness: random bookmarks, random chat history, random AI outputs, random half-remembered feedback.\n\nAI and LLMs are amazing. I use them every day. But they are not a replacement for understanding your user. They are a multiplier. If your understanding is shallow, they multiply noise. If your understanding is deep, they multiply leverage.\n\nSo what do we need when building products? Habits:\n\n- continuous learning about users\n- note-taking, even messy notes\n- connecting user insights to product decisions\n- creating content from what we learn\n\nWriting a blog post. Recording a short video. Sharing what we learned this week. This is not just content. It is consolidation. It is memory.\n\nAnd yes, it is overwhelming. If you feel lost sometimes, you are not broken. Most people building products feel this way right now. They just do not always say it.\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"my-6 space-y-2\">\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"flex items-center gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/30\">\n    \u003Cspan className=\"text-gray-400\">—\u003C/span>\n    \u003Cspan>I do not really know if users want this.\u003C/span>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"flex items-center gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/30\">\n    \u003Cspan className=\"text-gray-400\">—\u003C/span>\n    \u003Cspan>I am not sure we are solving the right problem.\u003C/span>\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"flex items-center gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/30\">\n    \u003Cspan className=\"text-gray-400\">—\u003C/span>\n    \u003Cspan>Everyone else seems to know their market better.\u003C/span>\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\nThat is why community matters more than ever. Talk to other builders. Share unfinished thoughts. Ask questions that feel too basic. Let people say I do not know. Create space where being confused is normal.\n\nWe do not need to pretend we have it all figured out. We need people who can ground us, help us zoom out, and remind us we are learning in public together.\n\nThe goal is not to know everything about your market. The goal is to keep building a better map of it, for users, for decisions, and for each other.\n\n\u003CDivider />\n\n## Deep-Dive: Knowledge Graphs, Triplets, and Why Time Matters\n\nAt the core, a knowledge graph is entities connected by relationships. The basic unit is a triplet:\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"my-6 p-4 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm\">\n  (subject, predicate, object)\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"info\" title=\"Triplet examples\">\n  - `(User-segment-A, struggles-with, onboarding-flow)`\n  - `(Feature-X, solves, Problem-Y)`\n  - `(Project-Z, uses, Postgres)`\n  - `(Decision-123, was-driven-by, user-feedback)`\n\u003C/Callout>\n\nWhen you link these triplets, you get a graph. Not a folder. Not a list. A web of connected ideas.\n\n### The Problem With Static Facts\n\nMost notes are static. But product knowledge is temporal:\n\n- we targeted enterprise, then pivoted to SMB in Q3\n- a pricing model worked until we hit a certain scale\n- competitor X was core, now competitor Y is\n\nIf your system does not track time, it quietly lies.\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-xl p-6 my-6 border-l-4 border-amber-500 italic text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">\n  A fact without a timestamp is a rumor waiting to mislead you.\n\u003C/div>\n\n### Temporal Knowledge Graphs\n\nA temporal fact is a triplet with time:\n\n```text\n(subject, predicate, object, valid_from, valid_to)\n```\n\nor:\n\n```text\n(subject, relation, object, timestamp)\n```\n\nThat lets you ask: what was true then, what is true now, and when did it change?\n\n### Interactive Graph Example\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"aspect-video w-full overflow-hidden rounded-[14px] border border-border bg-[#0b1220] shadow-[0_12px_30px_rgba(22,24,29,0.12)]\">\n  \u003Ciframe\n    className=\"block h-full w-full border-0\"\n    src=\"https://vasturiano.github.io/3d-force-graph/example/large-graph/\"\n    title=\"3D force graph large graph example\"\n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    referrerPolicy=\"no-referrer\"\n    allowFullScreen\n  />\n\u003C/div>\n\n### Types of Facts\n\n- Atemporal: always true\n- Static: true from a point in time and then stable\n- Dynamic: changes over time\n\nMost product knowledge is dynamic, and that is exactly the part that gets stale fastest.\n\n### Why Agents Are Interesting Here\n\nTemporal knowledge graph reasoning research suggests single-pass retrieval is fragile. Agentic approaches do better by:\n\n1. breaking questions into sub-queries\n2. retrieving with temporal constraints\n3. checking if facts are still valid\n4. iterating when context is missing\n\nThis mirrors real product debugging: you do not ask once, you probe and triangulate.\n\nTypical temporal operators:\n\n- `Search_time(query)`\n- `Search_specific(query, t)`\n- `Search_before(query, t)`\n- `Search_after(query, t)`\n- `Search_between(query, t1, t2)`\n\n### Practical Personal Setup\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"default\" title=\"You do not need a full system\">\n  You do not need to build a full temporal graph system to benefit:\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\"my-6 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n  \u003Cdiv className=\"p-4 rounded-lg bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800\">\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"font-semibold\">1.

For example, a T3-based address book:\n\n- fetch data\n- search\n- filter\n- sort\n- render responsive cards\n\nThen do the valuable part together:\n\n1. Live code a new requirement\n2. Write a mini spec on the fly\n3. Debate technical trade-offs\n4. Sketch algorithm choices\n5.
