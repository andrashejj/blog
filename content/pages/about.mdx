# Hi, I'm Andras 👋

![Andras Hejj](/images/posts/andras.png)

I'm a founder, software engineer, husband, and dad.

Made with 💕 in **Budapest**, 🌳 up in **Switzerland**, enjoying 🏄‍♂️ in **Mauritius**!

## What I'm building

I've spent the last ~20 years building products and companies.  
I started in bigger organizations, then moved into my own ventures:

- **NBK Labs**
- **Motif Labs**

Along the way, I learned that showing up fully and giving yourself consistently matters most, in work and in life.

## Life outside work

Mauritius is where I currently call home. It's where I can slow down, stay close to nature, and keep my focus on what really matters: **family**.

Being a husband and dad has shaped how I approach everything, from building products to running companies to day-to-day decisions.

## What I write about

This blog is a mix of:

- engineering and product
- startups and company building
- personal lessons from family and life

Some posts are technical, some personal, and some somewhere in between.
