As every year, I wake up on January 1 with a bit of a hangover. Not just from the amount of alcohol I consumed the previous night, although we had a big tasting round with my wife and our friends Arpi and Nunu from Tomcsanyi Birtok, but it felt different this time.

This year it was not only the wine. It was the weight of the whole year.

Starting a company. Raising two kids. Trying to keep work, marriage, and life in one piece. Family illness. War. Economic stress. It was a lot.

And still, when I look back, it was also a good year. Big joy, big lessons, and honestly a lot of chaos.

After the hangover came the quiet. We are lucky enough that my wife and I have awesome parents who love taking care of our kids, so we could sneak two days away. It was beautiful, relaxing, and we finally had the chance to talk, review the year that passed so fast, and plan the year ahead.

Those two days gave me enough headspace to set a few clear goals for this year.

Nothing heroic. Just things I know would make my life better if I actually stick to them:

1. Successfully finish dry January and replace drinking with sports.
2. Start cooking again. Every Friday night will be reserved for cooking with friends and family.
3. Be more calm and relaxed, trust myself, and keep helping others.
4. Get ready for Budapest while keeping the main base in Switzerland.

The point is not perfection. The point is consistency.

Let me see in a few months if I kept my own promises.
