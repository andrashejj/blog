One week into January, I usually see two modes around me.

Some people are still in holiday mode. Others sprint on day one like the whole year depends on week one.

I am somewhere in the middle this year.

I actually managed to recharge over Christmas, and I came back with energy instead of dread. That alone already feels like a win.

Dry January is still on track. It sounds like a small thing, but for me it is a reset button.

I also committed to moving more. I tried bodypump for the first time. Brutal during, great after.

Work-wise, January also started strong. I met several clients and closed some of the first deals of the year.

I am also back in learning mode: refreshing CSS (thanks [joshwcomeau.com](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)) and digging into MPC and threshold signatures for crypto asset protection beyond smart wallets.

There is a great article about this by 1kx network: [Wallets](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/wallets-91c7c3457578).

That is where I am right now: healthy momentum, real curiosity, and enough clarity to keep going.
