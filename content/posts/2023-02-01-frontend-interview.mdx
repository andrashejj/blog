Things I typically like to ask during a frontend dev interview:

- CSS fundamentals
- React pair coding ([challenge template](https://codesandbox.io/s/coding-challenge-template-7gkem1))

## CSS and layout questions

Can you explain CSS specificity?

Which units do you know, and when would you use each one?

- `%`
- `px`
- `em`
- `rem`
- `vh`

Let's talk about height. How would you style a div so it is full-page height?

Talk about internationalization and LTR/RTL. How would you style a paragraph with a `1em` margin at the end of text?

Talk about margins. How would you style a footer with predictable spacing?

Can you name different positioning algorithms and how they work?

- `static` (default)
- `initial`
- `absolute`
- `fixed`
- `relative`
- `sticky`

Explain the logic of an absolutely positioned element. How will it be positioned with `inset: 10px`?

## Stacking context

What is a stacking context? What are different ways to create one?

- Setting `opacity` to a value less than `1`
- Setting `position` to `fixed` or `sticky`
- Applying a `mix-blend-mode` other than `normal`
- Adding a `z-index` to a child inside a `display: flex` or `display: grid` container
- Using `transform`, `filter`, `clip-path`, or `perspective`
- Explicitly creating a context with `isolation: isolate`

How do you achieve a container that can overflow on the y-axis but not on x-axis?

One practical pattern is to use an outer wrapper to control clipping/rounding and an inner scroller to control the overflow behavior.
