Lately I think about knowledge in a very practical way.

Not academic. Not "look how smart this is." More like: how do I not drown while building products right now?

Everything is moving too fast. New tools every week, new frameworks, new channels, new opinions, new noise.

The old loop used to work for me: ship feature, check metrics, repeat.
Now that loop is not enough.

The hard part is not writing code. The hard part is deciding what deserves to be built.

Who is the actual user?
What problem are they really trying to solve?
What have they already tried?
What are they afraid of?
What does "solved" look like for them?

That is why I stopped thinking in lists and started thinking in connections.

A personal knowledge graph sounds fancy, but for me it just means this: connect what I learn to what I decide.

I use Obsidian very simply: small notes, links between ideas, post-call reflections, failed experiments, and surprises.

- notes about users (their words, not my interpretation)
- notes about problems (real vs assumed)
- notes about solutions (what worked, what flopped, what surprised me)
- notes about decisions (why I picked A over B)

If I do not build my own memory system, everything becomes random:
random bookmarks, random chat threads, random AI output, random half-memory.

I use AI every day and I genuinely love it.

But AI does not replace understanding your user.
It amplifies what you already have.

If your understanding is shallow, AI amplifies noise.
If your understanding is strong, AI amplifies leverage.

So what has actually helped me?

- continuous learning about users
- writing notes even when they are messy
- linking insights to product decisions
- creating content from what I learned

When I write a post, record a short video, or share weekly lessons, it is not "content strategy" first.
It is consolidation. It is memory.

And yes, this can feel overwhelming.

If you feel lost while building, you are not alone. Most founders and product builders I know feel this, they just do not always say it out loud.

<div className="my-6 space-y-2">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/30">
    <span className="text-gray-400">—</span>
    <span>I do not really know if users want this.</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/30">
    <span className="text-gray-400">—</span>
    <span>I am not sure we are solving the right problem.</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/30">
    <span className="text-gray-400">—</span>
    <span>Everyone else seems to know their market better.</span>
  </div>
</div>

That is also why community matters more now than before.

Talking to other builders helps me calibrate faster than sitting alone with assumptions. Sharing unfinished thoughts helps. Asking "basic" questions helps. Hearing "I do not know" from smart people helps.

I do not need to know everything about my market.
I need a better map than last week.

## Deep-Dive: Knowledge Graphs, Triplets, and Why Time Matters

At the core, a knowledge graph is entities connected by relationships. The basic unit is a triplet:

<div className="my-6 p-4 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg font-mono text-sm">
  (subject, predicate, object)
</div>

<Callout type="info" title="Triplet examples">
  - `(User-segment-A, struggles-with, onboarding-flow)`
  - `(Feature-X, solves, Problem-Y)`
  - `(Project-Z, uses, Postgres)`
  - `(Decision-123, was-driven-by, user-feedback)`
</Callout>

When these triplets are linked, you get a graph. Not a folder. Not a static list.

### The Problem With Static Facts

Most notes are static, but product truth is temporal:

- we targeted enterprise, then pivoted to SMB in Q3
- a pricing model worked until we hit a certain scale
- competitor X mattered a lot, now competitor Y does

If time is missing, your notes slowly become wrong while still looking organized.

<div className="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-xl p-6 my-6 border-l-4 border-amber-500 italic text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
  A fact without a timestamp is a rumor waiting to mislead you.
</div>

### Temporal Knowledge Graphs

A temporal fact is a triplet with time:

```text
(subject, predicate, object, valid_from, valid_to)
```

or:

```text
(subject, relation, object, timestamp)
```

That lets you ask what was true then, what is true now, and exactly when it changed.

### Interactive Graph Example

<div className="aspect-video w-full overflow-hidden rounded-[14px] border border-border bg-[#0b1220] shadow-[0_12px_30px_rgba(22,24,29,0.12)]">
  <iframe
    className="block h-full w-full border-0"
    src="https://vasturiano.github.io/3d-force-graph/example/large-graph/"
    title="3D force graph large graph example"
    loading="lazy"
    referrerPolicy="no-referrer"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>

### Types of Facts

- Atemporal: always true
- Static: true from a point in time and then stable
- Dynamic: changes over time

In product work, most important facts are dynamic. That is exactly why they become stale so quickly.

### Why Agents Are Interesting Here

Temporal knowledge graph research suggests single-pass retrieval breaks easily. Agentic flows do better by:

1. breaking a question into sub-queries
2. retrieving with temporal constraints
3. checking whether facts are still valid
4. iterating when context is missing

That is close to how real product debugging works anyway: probe, compare, update your model, repeat.

Typical temporal operators:

- `Search_time(query)`
- `Search_specific(query, t)`
- `Search_before(query, t)`
- `Search_after(query, t)`
- `Search_between(query, t1, t2)`

### Practical Personal Setup

<Callout type="default" title="You do not need a full system">
  You do not need to build a full temporal graph system to benefit:
</Callout>

<div className="my-6 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800">
    <div className="font-semibold">1. Track when things change</div>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800">
    <div className="font-semibold">2. Link facts to context</div>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800">
    <div className="font-semibold">3. Invalidate stale notes</div>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800">
    <div className="font-semibold">4. Connect notes instead of collecting</div>
  </div>
</div>

### Obsidian Workflow

My setup is simple:

- daily notes: what changed, what confused me
- concept notes: one atomic idea per note
- project notes: decisions, trade-offs, outcomes
- links between notes
- dates on decisions

Once a week, I clean duplicates, archive stale notes, and add missing links. Over time, that becomes a usable personal graph instead of a pile of disconnected notes.

For me, structured knowledge plus time-awareness is not theory. It is a way to stay sane while building.
