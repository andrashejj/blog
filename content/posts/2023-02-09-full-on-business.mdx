January disappeared. Feels like I blinked and it was over.

These were the big things for me:

- I successfully completed dry January. Lucky for me, one of my good friends Tamas was doing the same, so we happily drank alcohol-free beer together.
- We are starting a new chapter with my dad.
- At NBK Labs, Raphael (our lead developer) and we went separate ways, so I jumped into a much bigger frontend role.
- I started a CSS and React refresh at the beginning of January. Still in it. Still enjoying it.
- We took a week of half work and half holiday with my family and went skiing to the Austrian Alps. It was ice cold but amazing.
- We got a painful letter from FINMA and had to rebrand from nobank to something new (coming soon).
- We got our first month where we were cashflow neutral.

After all of that, I set a simple focus for the next stretch for myself and the company:

- Sell more and keep us in the green.
- Keep the dry January momentum and not slide back.
- Finish the CSS and React brush-up.
