Time flies, and real fast. January went by in a second, and there is so much that has happened.

Short summary of my highlights:

- I successfully completed dry January. Lucky for me, one of my good friends Tamas was doing the same, so we happily drank alcohol-free beer together.
- We are looking at a new chapter with my dad.
- At NBK Labs, we went separate paths with our lead developer Raphael, so I had to take on a big part of frontend development.
- I decided to refresh my CSS and React skills at the beginning of January. Still in the middle of it, and I love the journey.
- We took a week of half work and half holiday with my family and went skiing to the Austrian Alps. It was ice cold but amazing.
- We got a nasty letter from FINMA and had to change our branding from nobank to something new (coming soon).
- We got our first month where we were cashflow neutral.

With this behind us, and roughly 10 months to go this year, I also set focus for the next period for myself and the company:

- Sell more and make sure we are in the green.
- Enjoy life and continue the dry January momentum.
- Finish CSS and React brush-ups.
