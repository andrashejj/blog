summary: "The GTM playbook: Build B2C to find the 'soul' of the product, then strip the UI to sell a B2B2C engine. It sounds logical on paper, but closing contracts is a different beast entirely."

The technical playbook is consistent. I ship B2C first because it’s the only way to hear the raw customer voice—Catalin Fetean wrote a nice article on this [here](https://catalinfetean.substack.com/p/the-founder-led-marketing-playbook). If real people like the app, the engine is good.

But B2C growth follows a cruel curve. You hit a distribution wall where organic spikes end and paid growth becomes too expensive. I have learned that for most bootstrapped B2C products with zero ad spend, the "organic ceiling" usually sits somewhere between **1,000 and 5,000 total users**. Getting to that first thousand is about building a great product and hitting the right launch threads; getting past that milestone without a massive marketing budget or a viral loop is nearly impossible.

To solve this, I’ve evolved the approach: I strip the UI, package the underlying platform, and sell it as a **B2B2C** engine to partners who already have the users I want.

The strategy is sound, but the execution has taught me that "interest" is a vanity metric.

## "Interesting" is not a check

After many, many high-level conversations, I have learned that the feedback in B2B is often deceptively positive. People sign LOIs (Letters of Intent) and ask for pilots, but that rarely equates to a closed deal.

<Callout type="warning" title="The Lesson">
  An LOI is a compliment. A contract is oxygen.
</Callout>

### The Gauntlet
From what I've seen across various products, the path from "nice to meet you" to a signed contract usually looks like this:

1.  **The Hook**: Reaching out via cold email or intro.
2.  **The Ego Boost**: The "This is perfect for us" initial call.
3.  **The Champion**: Finding a lead who loves the tool but lacks budget authority.
4.  **The Demo Loop**: Repeating the pitch for stakeholders who weren't at the first meeting.
5.  **The Pilot**: A trial period that often slows down the momentum of a full sale.
6.  **The Security/Legal Wall**: Navigating compliance and 40-page vendor assessments.
7.  **The Contract**: The only step that counts toward the bottom line.

## Is it the product or the GTM?

When B2C growth stalls and B2B contracts move slowly, it’s easy to doubt the product. I have learned that if deals aren't closing after many attempts, it usually points to one of these roadblocks:

*   **Urgency**: The pain isn't painful enough to force a decision *today*.
*   **Ownership**: You are talking to a fan, not a buyer with a budget.
*   **Clarity**: The offer is too broad, making the ROI hard to quantify for a CFO.

## When the product is actually amazing

I have learned that having a "killer" product doesn't actually remove the gauntlet; it just changes who is doing the pushing. When the value is undeniable, the prospect becomes the one pulling you through the bureaucracy. The "Champion" isn't just a fan—they become an internal salesperson because your tool makes them look like a hero. In these cases, the legal and security reviews become high-priority tasks rather than chores. There is a collective organizational fear of the cost of *not* having the solution, and the conversation shifts from "Should we do this?" to "How fast can we turn this on?"

To identify if that shift is happening, I have learned to ignore what people say and focus entirely on their actions. Use this table to filter who is actually serious about a partnership:

| Strong Signals (The "Pull") | Weak Signals (The "Push") |
| :--- | :--- |
| Asking for security documentation | "This is very interesting" |
| Proactively introducing the procurement team | "Let's touch base next quarter" |
| Negotiating specific pricing terms | Signing a non-binding LOI |
| Asking for a technical rollout timeline | Asking for more "case studies" |

## Who writes the emails?

There is a massive temptation to buy a stack of AI-powered GTM tools, set up automated sequences, and blast thousands of leads. But for a product without traction, **automation is a multiplier for zero.** If your message doesn't resonate manually, AI will just help you fail at scale.

In the 8-person team stage, the founder—not a hired salesperson—must be the one writing and sending these emails. 

*   **The Founder's Advantage**: You can pivot the value prop mid-conversation. A sales hire will just stick to the script you gave them, even if it's failing.
*   **The Feedback Loop**: You need to feel the "ouch" of a rejection to understand if the product needs to change. 
*   **The "Unpolished" Factor**: Real SMB owners respond better to a "Founding Engineer looking for feedback" than a "BDR at XYZ Corp looking for 15 minutes of your time."

Save the expensive sequences for when you are bored of saying the same thing because it works every time. Until then, stay manual.

## Cold Outreach as a Filter

Cold outreach is the ultimate clarifier. When selling to SMBs, the feedback loop is fast, but the numbers are a reality check. A healthy campaign at this stage realistically yields a **1% to 3% positive reply rate**. If you send 100 highly targeted emails and get 2 or 3 people willing to take a call, you have a winning value proposition.

For a lean team, the trap is thinking you need to send 1,000 emails a week. That’s a fast track to the spam folder. The "sweet spot" for founder-led sales is **50 to 100 high-intent, manual outreaches per week**. This is enough to generate 1–3 discovery calls weekly without degrading into a "spam bot." 

You can't hide behind a pretty UI in a text-based email; the "engine" has to solve a real problem immediately. I keep a lightweight stack for this: a spreadsheet, a simple CRM, and templates that I iterate on constantly. The goal isn't volume—it’s the consistency of hitting those high-quality leads every single Monday morning.

## The Grind Continues

The modular approach—building a B2C "proof of life" before selling the B2B engine—remains the most capital-efficient way I know to build. It validates the tech before you spend months in a sales cycle.

One closed contract changes the entire trajectory. Until then, it's just about staying in the game.
