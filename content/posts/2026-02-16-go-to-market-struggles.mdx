I am involved in a few early-stage products right now. Different spaces, different teams, same repeating problem: the product is not the hard part.

The hard part is getting reliable distribution.

They are all software products, increasingly AI-first, and the GTM motion ends up being some mix of outbound, partnerships, and patience.

In one of them, I built a B2C app. People use it, retention is decent, feedback is good. And still: growth is not automatic. Not because the product is broken, but because acquiring users at scale is expensive.

In another, we are selling B2B. The product helps, the conversations are friendly, and progress is slow anyway. Not because buyers are malicious, but because B2B buying is a risk-management process.

This post is me trying to put structure around what has felt like chaos: what is actually happening when GTM feels hard, and what I am changing because of it.

<Divider />

## B2C is a budget game

Early-stage B2C often looks like this:

- you ship
- a small group tries it
- they like it
- growth flattens

That flat line is usually distribution.

Organic growth is great when it happens, but “go viral” is not a strategy. Most predictable channels cost money (ads, partnerships, creators, affiliates), and the price tends to rise before your unit economics do.

So the real question becomes: do we have a distribution edge, or do we have a product that needs one?

If you are bootstrapped (or just want optionality), you end up prioritizing distribution more than you want to. You spend less time arguing about features and more time asking:

- which channel can we actually win?
- what is the loop that brings new users in?
- what is the hook that makes someone share this?
- what is the thing we can do that competitors won’t (or can’t) copy quickly?

<Divider />

## So I went B2B2C (selling the engine)

I did not really pivot. The consumer app is still core. But I stopped treating it as “the business model” and started treating it as proof that the underlying system works.

The pragmatic move has been: sell the platform to companies that already have distribution.

B2B2C, for me, is a simple structure:

- the app is proof
- the platform is what we sell
- the partner brings distribution

Same engine. Different buyer. Different expectations.

## The new problem: nobody buys fast

The part I underestimated: B2B rarely says “no”. It says “not yet”.

That sounds encouraging, but it creates a trap: you can spend months collecting positive signals that never convert into revenue.

I am not against LOIs, pilots, and internal champions. They are part of the process. The problem is when they become the process.

In B2B, a deal is not a single decision. It is a sequence of risk checks.

### What the process actually looks like

In theory, sales is a funnel. In practice, it is a checklist that can stall at any point:

1. outreach or intro
2. first call (do they have the problem?)
3. follow-up (do they care enough?)
4. stakeholders (who else needs to say yes?)
5. pilot proposal (what are we proving and how fast?)
6. security + legal (are we allowed?)
7. procurement (are we buying?)
8. signature + invoice (did it happen?)

Every step can kill momentum, and “yes” often means “yes, if everything else goes smoothly”.

I cannot force a company to buy, but I can remove ambiguity and make the next step real.

The fastest conversations I have had usually include:

- a specific pain (not a vague “could be useful”)
- a specific owner (not “the team”)
- a dated next step (not “let’s stay in touch”)

<Divider />

## The spiral: does this mean the product sucks?

When things move slowly in both B2C and B2B, the brain goes to a dark place:

- maybe the product is not good
- maybe the positioning is wrong
- maybe I am just bad at sales

The truth is messier than any single explanation.

Slow B2C does not automatically mean the product is bad. Trust is low, switching costs are real, and channels are expensive.

Slow B2B does not automatically mean execution is bad. B2B is structurally slow, especially when risk is high.

But: if nobody buys after enough real attempts, it is still a signal. When I dig in, I usually find one of these:

- the pain is not urgent
- I am talking to the wrong buyer (champions are not budget owners)
- the offer is unclear (what are they actually buying?)
- the ROI story is fuzzy
- the market is early and nobody wants to be first

So yes: the product can be good while the deal is not ready. But “not ready” is also information.

<Divider />

## Buying signals vs. polite signals

Big lesson for me: listen less to enthusiasm, and more to actions.

Strong signals tend to look like:

- they pull in the budget owner
- they ask for pricing
- they ask for a contract or order form
- they want security documentation
- they ask “how fast can we roll this out?”

Weak signals tend to look like:

- friendly feedback with no next step
- “let’s explore” without a timeline
- a pilot that is intentionally unscoped
- anything that pushes the decision into an undefined future

<Divider />

## Technique: cold emails + systems

Cold outreach is still the most humbling machine I know. Most people do not reply. Some reply with a polite no. Some engage and then disappear.

But outreach does one useful thing: it forces clarity. You cannot hide behind abstract value props. You need a clear buyer, a clear pain, and a clear reason to care now.

The other thing I learned: consistency matters more than cleverness. A good week of outreach beats a perfect email I never send.

<Callout type="default" title="Reality check">
  Tooling does not create traction. But good tooling reduces friction and makes the work repeatable.
</Callout>

For me, “tooling” is not Excel. It is a small outbound + pipeline system:

- a CRM as the source of truth (stages, next steps, owners)
- sequencing for outbound (so I can follow up without thinking)
- enrichment + list building to find the right buyer
- AI-assisted research and personalization (fast first drafts, but I still edit)
- call notes + transcripts so I do not lose details across companies
- a few templates: pilot scope, security answers, ROI framing, pricing one-pager
- a landing page with one clear CTA and basic analytics

The goal is not sophistication. The goal is to keep moving every week, across multiple products, without resetting to zero.

<Divider />

## What I am planning next: a roadshow

My next move is a focused roadshow with warm intros.

I am not expecting to walk out with signed enterprise contracts on the spot. That almost never happens. What I want is momentum that is concrete:

- a small paid pilot with a clear scope
- agreement on success metrics and a timeline
- a dated next step with the budget owner in the room

If I can leave meetings with a real owner, a real pain, and a real timeline, that is a win. Contract can come later, after the usual security, legal, and procurement steps.

<Divider />

## Conclusion

Right now, product quality is not my main bottleneck.

Distribution is.

In B2C, distribution is attention and economics.
In B2B, distribution is trust, timing, budgets, and internal alignment.

I still do not feel like I “know GTM”. But I do feel less confused than a year ago. Mostly because I stopped treating GTM as vibes and started treating it as a system: clear buyer, clear pain, clear offer, consistent outreach, and measurable next steps.
