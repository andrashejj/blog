I built something.
It works.
People who use it seem to like it.

And yet, I have no idea how to turn that into a business.

## The validation trap

Everyone says "talk to users."
So I talk to users.

They say "this is useful."
They say "I would use this."
They say "this solves a real problem."

And then nothing happens.

No signup. No conversion. No referral. Just a pleasant conversation and radio silence afterward.

I used to think this meant the product was broken. Now I think it might mean something else entirely: **polite feedback is not product validation**.

## The friends and family problem

Early on, I made the mistake of testing with people who knew me.

"Why would I not try it? Sure, send me the link."

They tried it. They said nice things. A few even signed up.

But here is what I learned: **their enthusiasm was about me, not the product**.

They wanted to support me. They felt bad saying no. They gave me the feedback they thought I wanted to hear.

The moment I talked to strangers, the signal changed. Not worse, just different. More honest. More useful. But also much, much harder to get.

## The advocate drought

Real advocates are rare. I am learning this the hard way.

An advocate is not someone who says "nice product."
An advocate is someone who uses it without being asked, tells others about it unprompted, and gets annoyed when it does not work the way they expect.

I have not found many of those.

What I have found are:

- Curious people who never follow up
- Enthusiastic people who disappear after the first week
- People who say they will share it, then do not
- People who share it once, then move on

Maybe this is normal. Maybe this is what early-stage feels like. But it does not feel like progress. It feels like swimming in place.

## Almost there, but not quite

The hardest part is the distance between "almost" and "there."

The product works.
The feedback is positive.
People understand what it does.

But "almost" does not pay bills. "Almost" does not create momentum. "Almost" is just a nice way to describe failure that has not happened yet.

I keep thinking: if I just add one more feature, if I just fix this one pain point, if I just make it a little better — then it will click.

Maybe that is true.
Maybe that is just another form of avoidance.

## Selling without selling out

Here is the tension I cannot resolve:

I need validation to keep going.
I need customers to prove this is real.
But I also cannot change direction every time someone suggests something.

If I listen to every piece of feedback, I will end up with a diluted version of nothing.
If I ignore all feedback, I will build something nobody wants.

So I am trying to find a middle ground:

- Listen to what people actually do, not what they say
- Look for patterns, not single data points
- Trust my gut when it contradicts polite feedback
- Keep building, but build with intention

## One step at a time

I do not have a go-to-market strategy.
I do not have a sales funnel.
I do not have a growth hypothesis.

What I have is:

- A product that works
- A handful of people who use it regularly
- The willingness to keep asking, keep reaching out, and keep being told no

Maybe that is enough.
Maybe I am learning the wrong lessons.
Maybe I will look back at this post and cringe at how naive I was.

But for now, this is where I am:
Not succeeding.
Not failing.
Just — still in the game.

One step at a time.
