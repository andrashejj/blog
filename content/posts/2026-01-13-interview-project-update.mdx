I started with a small interview challenge and turned it into a public project:

- Source code: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andrashejj/interview)
- Live demo: [interview-eight-rosy.vercel.app](https://interview-eight-rosy.vercel.app/)

What I care about is not the stack itself.

What I care about is this: interviews still test for a world that does not exist anymore.

## The old interview format is dying

For years, technical interviews looked like this:

- no internet
- no docs
- no helper tools
- one person, one editor, one timer

I never loved this format.

It mostly tests memory and stress response. It does not test how someone actually works on a real team.

In real life we use docs, search, AI tools, and each other. So interviews should reflect that.

## What I want interviews to become

Start with a shared build. For example, a T3-based address book:

- fetch data
- search
- filter
- sort
- render responsive cards

Then do the part that matters, together:

1. Live code a new requirement
2. Write a mini spec on the fly
3. Debate technical trade-offs
4. Sketch algorithm choices
5. Decide what to postpone and why

<div className="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/50 rounded-xl p-6 my-6 border-l-4 border-amber-500 italic text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
  This is where engineering shows up for me. Not "who remembers API trivia", but:
</div>

- who asks sharp questions
- who can structure ambiguity
- who collaborates under constraints
- who can make safe, reversible decisions quickly

## The AI-era skill is not coding faster

For me, the AI-era skill is **thinking better with others**.

AI can produce code quickly.
It cannot own accountability, production risk, or product judgment.

So in an interview, I pay attention to this:

<div className="my-6 space-y-2">
  {[
    { icon: "🎯", text: "Can we turn an idea into a clear spec?" },
    { icon: "🛡️", text: "Can we split work into safe increments?" },
    { icon: "🔍", text: "Can we identify failure modes early?" },
    { icon: "📢", text: "Can we explain trade-offs to non-engineers?" },
    { icon: "🔄", text: "Can we adapt when assumptions break?" },
  ].map((item, i) => (
    <div key={i} className="flex items-center gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800/30">
      <span className="text-xl">{item.icon}</span>
      <span>{item.text}</span>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>

## From one address book, many interview directions

The nice part is that one small base project opens many real discussions.

From the same address book, I can explore with candidates:

- product thinking (what problem are we actually solving?)
- UX decisions (search behavior, empty states, mobile-first flows)
- API design (contracts, versioning, error models)
- data modeling (normalization, indexing, trade-offs)
- algorithm choices (sort/filter strategy, performance implications)
- testing strategy (unit vs integration vs end-to-end)
- reliability (timeouts, retries, graceful degradation)
- security and auth boundaries
- observability (logs, traces, metrics, alerting)
- team collaboration (specs, RFCs, code review style, rollout planning)

That is why I like this format.

We can build, discuss, challenge assumptions, and see how someone thinks while the situation changes.

## The interview I want to have

Give me a real problem.
Let us build version one together.
Then ask: "Where do we take this next, and why?"

I learn more from that conversation than from any perfect kata.

In this AI era, I trust engineers who can think, ship, and evolve systems with other people.

<div className="my-10 p-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 via-gray-800 to-gray-900 rounded-2xl text-white text-center">
  <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-light leading-relaxed">
    Give me a real problem. Let us build version one together.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-400 mt-4">
    That tells me much more than speed alone.
  </p>
</div>
